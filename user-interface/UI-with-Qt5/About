The interface is designed by Qt5 creator, which is a .ui file. Then a header file ui_mainwindow.h can be generated from it.

Aftering calling ui_mainwindow.h in mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp, and doing some modification in the original code, 
the UI can be used in the source file.

Then we can customize the function we need. In the Qt, a widget action can be seen as emitting a signal,
and a slot is called when a signal connected to it is emitted.  Slots are normal C++ functions and can be called normally.

A simple example:
QObject::connect(Exit, SIGNAL(clicked()), MainWindow, SLOT(close()));
Here the button Exit is the sender; clicked() is the signal meaning the button is clicked; MainWindow is the receiver;
the slot close() is called when the signal is emitted, meaning the receiver MainWindow is closed.

About the widgets in the UI:
Button Start: When it clicked, the motor and the Gamry measurement begin to work.
Button Exit: Exit the application. (It is not a button very in need).
in the GroupBox Choosing Valve: Two buttons to decide which valve is opened. 
in the GroupBox Motor Speed: To change the motor speed by scrollbar or spinbox;
System time is showed at the bottom-left of the window.
Helpmenu: To open user guide by Guide and to show basic information of this test bed by About. ( It is a idea, 
I will try to reach the goal that a text file or a .doc file can be opened when choose a option.)
