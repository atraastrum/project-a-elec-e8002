The UI project file that the group will implement is in the UI-with-Qt5 folder.

In the folder "examples", I have uploaded two UI projects designed by python and C++ programming separately, 
which build the same UI apperance as the one in the UI-with-Qt5. The group doesn't need them anymore. 
You can have a look if you are interested. 

To run the UI project, Installation and configuration of Qt5 is needed. 
When running the UI designed by python, you also need to install pyqt5. 

But there is no need for members to run the UI file. 
The image "mainwindow" shows the UI apperance. Everyone can see what the mainwindow looks just from the image "mainwindow".
And a text file about the UI and some idea is in the folder UI-with-Qt5, which everyone can read and modify.

The UI needs to be modified of course. Everyone who thinks there should be something in need to be added in the UI
or has any suggestions can tell me via Whatapp, slack or just writes down the points here.
