Short description about the project here:

user-interface: User interface to comuticate with device and potentiostat and plot and examine the results. The computer on which this software is installed is called Application PC 
mcu-code: Here all the code related to low level hardware programming like controlling the pump and electtrical valves. Internal device computer
gamry-600-reference: code that is responsible for handeling data from potentiostat "mdoel gamry reference 600" on application PC.  

For user-interface and gamry-600-reference our primary tools are CPP and QT. It is to be desided how Software on Application PC will communicate with Internal computer.  

For mcu-code: hardware team decides.
